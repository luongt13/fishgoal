## SWOT Analysis
**Strengths:**

I am clear as to what I would like to accomplish with my project. I anticipate to implement the design I have planned. 

**Weaknesses:**

I am not completely comfortable with CRUD and the component hierarchy. Getting the components mentally organized takes a little more time. 

**Opportunities:**

This opportunity will solidify my understanding of React and reinforce my knowledge in HTML/CSS/JavaScript. 

**Threats:**

I tend to tackle the problem on my own, but sometimes I spend more time than I have to struggling on a problem. It's okay to reach out to my resources.
